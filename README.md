# GUI_Asset-Class
Windows Form App for Asset Class using C# 
# Description
(Asset Class) Create a class called Asset that includes three pieces of information as either
instance variables or auto-implemented properties—asset name (type string), asset value (type
decimal) and depreciation rate (type decimal). Your class should have a constructor that initializes
the three values. Provide a property with a get and set accessor for any instance variables. If the asset
value or depreciation rate is negative, the set accessor should leave the instance variable unchanged.
Write a test app named AssetTest that demonstrates class Asset’s capabilities.
Create two Asset objects and display each object's amount of depreciation and their depreciated value. 
Then increase the value of each asset by 5% and display each asset's amount of depreciation and their depreciated value.
